The idea is simple, and yet very powerful. A distributed application makes forward progress by transitioning from one state to another, just like a state machine. The difference from traditional state machines, however, is that the possible states and the transitions between them are not known in advance. Instead, as the application reaches a new state, the next possible transitions are discovered. It’s like a treasure hunt.
